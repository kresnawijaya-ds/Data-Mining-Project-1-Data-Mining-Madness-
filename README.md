Examining the correlation between library occupancy &amp; electricity consumption

Given wifi dataset and library dataset

WiFi Data (wifi.csv) contains connection counts (Associated Client Count) for all campus building.
    For this project, i must filter and use only the WiFi data from the Library building.
    This serves as a proxy for library occupancy. The more devices connected, the more people are likely present.

Library Energy Data (library1.csv, library2.csv, library3.csv) records electricity use from three meters in the library every 10 minutes. This reflects the energy demand of the library.
